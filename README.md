# my dotfiles
This is my collection of dotfiles for i3, polybar, zsh, oh-my-zsh, urxvt, dunst, rofi and compton.  I don't currently use any kind of installation script, but I may add one in the future.

# warning
I'm certain these dotfiles won't work out of the box as I never originally intended to upload them to GitHub, so use them more as a reference for your own dotfiles than as a drop-in replacement.  I've also included my custom scripts directory as they are referenced quite a bit throughout my .i3/config file.  Some of the included scripts and config decisions specific to my setup as I'm using an older MacBook Air which comes with some hardware incompatabilities.
